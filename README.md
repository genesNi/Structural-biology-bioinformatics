# My Thesis based on docking
this thesis was written as a part of last two semester projectes during Masters, it has a lot of things which could have been done differently. 
all the proteins which are reprodcutive markers didn't had an actual X-ray Crystallographic structures so all the Alpha-fold structures have been used for docking.
simulation studies of all the proteins can still be done to conclude better interactions.
both the zip files which are available has individual folders for each protein and for each plant extracts and docking results .
